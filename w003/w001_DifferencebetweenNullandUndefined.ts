Null
    Null is used to represent an intentional absence of value. It represents a variable whose value is undefined.
    It accepts only one value, which is null. The Null keyword is used to define the Null type in TypeScript,
    but it is not useful because we can only assign a null value to it.*/

//Variable declared and assigned to null
const a = null;
console.log( a );   //output: null
console.log( typeof(a) );   //output: object
